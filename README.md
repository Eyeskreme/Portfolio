# My Personal Portfolio

#### Description:
This is my Personal Portfolio Website for CS50 Final Project. 

I use NEXTJS and ReactJS frameworks in Javascript to create this website. It is mainly a front-end web development project with dynamic and interactive User Interface to enhance my website to the users. You can see my journey in my learning of IT and especially in programming domain during my course of study. 

All my source code can be found in src folder.

You can also take a look at some of my personal projects I have done throughout my journey in learning many programming languages and also my Hackathon project prototype where I won first place.

Feel free to contact me through email/social media that can be found in my portfolio website!
